(1) Abstract



(2) Problem Setup

Intially our team goal was to classify dance moves from video frames, however after realizing there would be a large amount of effort used to collect and organize dancing images to train and test on we instead opted for the suggested 'Bird Classification Competition' from Kaggle. This was suggested by Professor Redmon. From this, the goal is to develop a classifier for winter birds based on a dataset of 10,000+ images.

(3) Dataset

The data set consists of 10,0000 images of various birds. A list of all the birds can be found in the 'names.txt' file.
